# CodeAlpha_Task3_HandwrittenRecognition

## 📚 Project Name:
**Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN**

## 🚀 About the Project:
This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship.**  
The objective is to build a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits (0 to 9) using deep learning with a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

The model is trained on the famous **MNIST dataset**, which consists of **70,000 images** of handwritten digits.
